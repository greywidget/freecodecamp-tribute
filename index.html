        Peter Snell is still recognised as New Zealand's greatest Olympian with 
        his golden double in the 800m and 1500m set in Tokyo in 1964. His New 
        Zealand 800m record set in 1962 still stands.

        The great Lord Sebastion Coe, himself a winner of four Olympic medals 
        and eight world records in middle-distance running, said of his friend: 
        <blockquote cite="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018727089/sir-peter-snell-s-friend-recalls-record-breaking-olympian">
          Sir Peter was a giant of athletics by any standard, in any era.
